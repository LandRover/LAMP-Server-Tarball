# Note that this file is used for any unspecified service; for example
#if /opt/local/etc/Linux-PAM/cron  specifies no session modules but cron calls
#pam_open_session, the session module out of /opt/local/etc/Linux-PAM/other is
#used.  If you really want nothing to happen then use pam_permit.so or
#pam_deny.so as appropriate.

# We fall back to the system default in /opt/local/etc/Linux-PAM/common-*
